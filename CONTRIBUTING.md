## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. Ensure the test suite passes.
4. Issue that pull request!
